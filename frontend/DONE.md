# Frontend MVP Status

## Completed
- **Gamified Home Screen**: 
    - Implemented `CloudWidget` with custom `PixelCloudPainter` to generate pixel-art clouds programmatically (Clear, Cloudy, Storm states).
    - `DashboardScreen` layouts for Desktop (Side-by-side) and Mobile (Vertical).
- **Add Task Flow**:
    - `AddTaskButton` updated with Pixel Cloud branding.
    - `AddTaskScreen` with AI Context input.
- **AI Integration**:
    - `PlanReviewScreen` with polling logic and Suggestion Carousel.
- **Theming**:
    - "Baby Blue" Sky theme with `GoogleFonts.pressStart2p` for headers and rounded "cloud-like" components.

## Verified
- No missing assets (replaced `Image.asset` with `CustomPainter`).
- Navigation (`AppDrawer`) links all key screens.
